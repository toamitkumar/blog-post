My first experience was during the build of MDL (McKinsey Digital Labs) by our leaders: Satty Bhens and Biju Bhaskar. They both are strong believers of garage-like setup and gave full support to establish guard-rails in protecting the culture. We built a solid team of 150+ engineers globally following hubs-spokes model knitted together with an Engineering Mindset &amp;amp; connected via various communication tools.</description></item><item><title>Re-Engineer v/s Rewrite</title><link>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2021/11/24/reengineer-vs-rewrite/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2021/11/24/reengineer-vs-rewrite/</guid><description>We are engineers (can be safely generalised to humans), who at heart enjoy building not extending/enhancing/improving
Disclaimer: doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy extending/enhancing. I strongly believe in the philosophy of &amp;ndash; You touch it, you improve it!
This is driven by the fact - programmers think old code is messy as Joel Spolsky writes &amp;ndash; It’s harder to read code than to write it
Having said that, programmers use tonne of external libraries &amp;amp; modules to avoid re-inventing the wheel.</description></item><item><title>Guardrail-ed Autonomy</title><link>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2021/01/30/guardrail-ed-autonomy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2021/01/30/guardrail-ed-autonomy/</guid><description>I haven’t written much in recent years, at least not through blog posts. I thought 2021, would be a good time to start penning some of my thoughts &amp;amp; learnings I have had in the recent past years.
Team formation, functioning, reporting are the most common challenges every organisation have. Lately, I have been involved in discussions related to Team Autonomy. Hence, this article.
Autonomy has different meaning based on context: political, medical, HR, organisation.</description></item><item><title>Managing multiple SSH Keys with Github &amp; Gitlab</title><link>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2012/08/05/manage-multiple-ssh-github-gitlab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2012/08/05/manage-multiple-ssh-github-gitlab/</guid><description>I have always stumbled on this problem of managing SSH keys for multiple Git based SCM (Gitlab, GitHub) including multiple GitHub accounts.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve single account - adding the SSH keys on your github or gitlab is simple.
I currently have the following accounts:
Github 1 personal account 2 behind the firewall (corporate accounts) Gitlab 1 personal account 1 corporate account If ever face a problem like this, it is best to create a ssh-config file which aggregates all your SSH keys.</description></item><item><title>My Impression at #inspect2013 - RubyMotion Conference</title><link>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2013/04/09/ruby-motion-conference/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.github.io/2013/04/09/ruby-motion-conference/</guid><description>The first RubyMotion Conference #inspect2013 happened in Brussels, Belgium.
