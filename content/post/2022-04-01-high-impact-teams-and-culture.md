I have always wondered what makes a group of people (either cross-functional or similar skills) become high performant or a **High Impact**. 
team.
<!-- I was recently in a team-building exercise where we discussed the traits of a **High Impact Team**.  -->

Google researchers wanted to understand the secrets of effective teams. The research was code-named **{{< link_target_blank href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/" title="Project Aristotle" >}}** following the quote:

> the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

They found that great teams are not driven by free lunches, great benefits, or wonderful salaries. Additionally, _what really mattered was less about who is in the team but more about how the team works together_. 

### Five traits of an effective team:
- _Psychological safety_: a belief that a team is safe for risk-taking and not seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive
- _Dependability_: which has been one of the important guiding principles - [Predictability](/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/#4-be-predictable) 
- _Structure and clarity_: clarity of responsibilities, direction, and objectives.
- _Meaning_: personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression
- _Impact_: seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals and can help reveal impact.

These traits are heavily dependent on the _culture of the organisation_ - a topic that has fascinated me, because I have been in a few transformative journeys including [building an Engineering](/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/) setup from scratch. 

### What is culture?
It is important to understand what is _culture_ (a term that is used loosely). To me:

> Culture is an outcome of principles and practices followed by the team (or organisation)

In essence, culture drives how a team (or an ogranisation) responds to challenges (internal or external) and opportunities it encounters.

#### Communication flows
One of the other important aspects of culture building is how communication flows (relevance, timeliness, and appropriateness to the recipient). And I have seen, information flow is driven by **typology** of the organisation. 

1. Pathological: communication stops due to political reasons (power or glory)
2. Bureaucratic: communication moves slowly due to ogranisational boundaries (rules, position, departmental turfs)
3. Generative: communication concentrates on the mission and arrives to the relevant people fastest

Good communication flow builds cooperation, creativity, and safety.

#### How typology impacts the traits of effective teams
The typology shapes activities such as communication, cooperation, innovation, and problem solving. Let's look at how typology impacts the traits of effective teams.

##### _Psychological safety_
When things go wrong:
- pathological encourage finding a _scapegoat_
- bureaucratic organisations _seek justice_. Thinking may stop at the department’s boundary because what is beyond it is _not my concern_, even though it may be of great concern to the mission
- the generative ones tries to discover the root cause with the system (strives to be ***blameless***). People are encouraged to speak up, think outside the box, and to act as fully conscious participants in a great cooperative enterprise

##### _Structure and clarity_
- in pathological the implications for power struggles are the focus of awareness
- bureaucratic setup constricts awareness by personal or departmental function
- in a generative organisation, team members are made aware about the situation - what is happening and why.

##### Meaning and Impact
- in pathological organisations, alignment is typically with a person or a clique, whose interests are advanced in preference to other loyalties.
- in a bureaucratic organisation, alignment with the person’s own unit or function takes the place of alignment with the mission.
- in a generative organisation, alignment takes place through identification with the mission. 

> Culture shapes three key variables: alignment, awareness, and empowerment.

-  organisational culture bears a predictive relationship with safety

A culture is defined as the organisation’s pattern of response to the challenges (external or internal) and opportunities () it encounters
Culture for an organisation as analogous to personality of the individual
- How can we classify cultures?
- How do cultures develop?
- Do Values have any influence on culture?
- Can different functions in the organisation have different cultures?
- Can it be tangibly measured? Or it can only be inferred by its behavior?
- How can these cultures be changed or improved?
- Does culture attract talent, growing them and retaining them to do excellent work
- Can you document the culture documented? Is it tribal and unspoken?
- how do you describe culture to an interviewee?
- Is it organic and keeps changing with new hires?


Information flow (relevance, timeliness, and appropriateness to the recipient) is one way to understand the Typology of the organisation - hoards (holds up) due to political reasons, or languishes (moves slow) due to bureaucratic barriers. Good information flow tends to favour cooperation, creativity, and safety compared to decrease creativity, create conflict, and make the organisation involved less safe.

The typology shapes activities such as communication, cooperation, innovation, and problem solving.

**Alignment**
- In a generative organisation, alignment takes place through identification with the mission. 
- in a bureaucratic organisation, alignment with the person’s own unit or function takes the place of alignment with the mission.
- In pathological organisations, alignment is typically with a person or a clique, whose interests are advanced in preference to other loyalties. 

**Awareness**
- In a generative organisation, team members are made aware about the situation - what is happening and why. 
- awareness is necessarily constricted by personal or departmental function in bureaucratic organisations
- In pathological organisations, the implications for power struggles are the focus of awareness.

**Empowerment**
- encouraged to speak up, think outside the box, and to act as fully conscious participants in a great cooperative enterprise
-  thinking may stop at the department’s boundary because what is beyond it is ‘‘not my concern’’, even though it may be of great concern to the mission
- 


A focus on personal needs leads to a pathological environment, a focus on departmental turf to a bureaucratic style, and a focus on the mission to a generative style.
