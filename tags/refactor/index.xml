Disclaimer: doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy extending/enhancing. I strongly believe in the philosophy of &amp;ndash; You touch it, you improve it!
This is driven by the fact - programmers think old code is messy as Joel Spolsky writes &amp;ndash; Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it
Having said that, programmers use tonne of external libraries &amp;amp; modules to avoid re-inventing the wheel.</description></item></channel></rss>
