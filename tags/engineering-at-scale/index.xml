My first experience was during the build of MDL (McKinsey Digital Labs) by our leaders: Satty Bhens and Biju Bhaskar. They both are strong believers of garage-like setup and gave full support to establish guard-rails in protecting the culture. We built a solid team of 150+ engineers globally following hubs-spokes model knitted together with an Engineering Mindset &amp;amp; connected via various communication tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
